# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails-app/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
rails-app/db/*.sqlite3
rails-app/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails-app/log/*
rails-app/tmp/*
!rails-app/log/.keep
!rails-app/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
rails-app/storage/*
!rails-app/storage/.keep

rails-app/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
rails-app/config/master.key
